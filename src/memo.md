## üß± Component Structure Summary

### `App.tsx`

```tsx
<DragDropContext onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
  <Wrapper>
    <Form>
      {" "}
      <BoardInput />{" "}
    </Form>
    <Boards>
      {" "}
      <Board />{" "}
    </Boards>
    <TrashZone />
  </Wrapper>
</DragDropContext>
```

### `Board.tsx`

```tsx
<Wrapper>
  <Title>
    {" "}
    <Form />{" "}
  </Title>
  <Droppable>
    <Area>
      {" "}
      <DraggableCard />{" "}
    </Area>
  </Droppable>
</Wrapper>
```

### `Draggable.tsx`

```tsx
<Draggable>
  <Card />
</Draggable>
```

## üß† `onDragEnd` Handler Logic

1. Check whether the dragged item is a **board** or a **card**
2. If it is a **board**:
   - Reorder boards within the board list
   - If dropped into the `TrashZone`, delete the board
3. If it is a **card**:
   - Reorder cards within the same board
   - Move the card to a different board
   - If dropped into the `TrashZone`, delete the card

  ],
  "Doing": [
    { id: 125, text: "c" }
  ]
}
```

### ‚úÖ After

```ts
[
  {
    id: 0,
    board: "To Do",
    items: [
      { id: 123, text: "a" },
      { id: 124, text: "b" },
    ],
  },
  {
